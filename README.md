**GAIN Latitude: Donate your altitude data.**

This [simple app](http://gain-latitude.appspot.com) connects to your Google Latitude account via OAuth 2.0 using Google's APIs Client Library for Python. It runs on App Engine and uses the Users service to provide authentication.

It also is an early Christmas gift for [brunosan](https://github.com/brunosan).
